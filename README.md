# Memory Card Game

This web page is a memory card game application, made using the React framework.

The game is very simple. You click on any image you haven't clicked before. every tiem you click an image you haven't clicked before, you get a new point. If you, however, click an image that you've already clicked bfore, then your score resets. If you score before losing was higher than you current high score, it will be replaced by the new highest score.

## Motivation

This project was made as an assingment for The Odin Project, specifically for the React section. It was intended to give me practice with using React's components and the State Hook provided by react.
